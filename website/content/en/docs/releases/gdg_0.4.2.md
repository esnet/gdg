#  DRAFT Release Notes for v0.4.2


### New Features
  - Adding CLI Tooling around tokens and service Accounts
  - Team CRUD support (Permissioning not persisted) See issue [149](https://github.com/esnet/gdg/issues/149)
  - Added Better filtering for datasource to Auth mapping


####  Configuration Changes
  - DataSource has had a configuration overhaul.  It is technically backward compatible, all previous tests work, with the previous config, but I would highly encourage people to migrate.  Next feature I will drop the backward support.
