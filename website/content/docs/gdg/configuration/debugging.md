## Debugging / Trouble shooting

There are two configuration flags that can be very useful to determine the issue.

```yaml
...
global:
  debug: true
  api_debug: true
```

The debug flag enables very logging which may provide some insight on the core issue that you're running into.  Additionally, api_debug
when enabled with print every request being made and response.

For example, attempting to upload all the given folders I get the follow response.

{{< details "API Logs" >}}
```sh
POST /api/folders HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
User-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1
Content-Length: 36
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
Content-Type: application/json
X-Grafana-Org-Id: 1
Accept-Encoding: gzip

{"title":"Other","uid":"CWSuYt_nk"}

HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
Content-Length: 80
Cache-Control: no-store
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Wed, 11 Sep 2024 17:07:57 GMT
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: deny
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block

{"message":"a folder with the same name already exists in the current location"}
```

{{< /details >}}

As you can see from the logs, a POST request was made to `http://localhost:3000/api/folders`, the payload was
```json
{"title":"Other","uid":"CWSuYt_nk"}
```

It returned a 409 status since the folder already exists and the response was:
```json
{"message":"a folder with the same name already exists in the current location"}
```
