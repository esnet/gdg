## Release Notes for v0.9.0

**Release Date: 12/31/2025**

### Min Recommended Grafana Versions:
 - Grafana 11+

### Breaking Changes
  - [#502](https://github.com/esnet/gdg/pull/502) Password and Tokens in config file has been deprecated.
  - [#510](https://github.com/esnet/gdg/pull/510) Renamed default config to gdg.(yaml|yml)
  - [#513](https://github.com/esnet/gdg/pull/513) Changed location of S3 secure auth.
    - Additionally:
      - `custom`: `true` flag has been removed. It was deprecated 0.8.x. Please use `cloud_type`: `custom`
        instead.
      - Behavioral change. AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY will now override config values. This is now consistent with
        how the rest of the GDG config handled env overrides.
  - [#504](https://github.com/esnet/gdg/pull/504) Changing behavior of alert rules. Since they are tied to a given folder, the
     rules will be saved in the given folder. Additionally, folder filtering has been added to allow a user to only
     include rules they are interested in.
