## Release Notes for v0.8.0
**Release Date: 05/11/2025**

Major features in this release are:
- Dropped the configuration flag for nested folders (`nested_folders`) as it is now the default behavior.
- Dropped the configuration flag to ignore bad folders (`nested_folders`), instead special characters are handled by
URL encoding the output.

aka. Folder named `/t/'n / r'/booh/k & r` will be stored locally as: `t/n+%2F+r/booh/n+%2F+r.json`

This should allow us to support any folder name but if you have a folder with special characters in its name any regex you
are using should be updated accordingly.
