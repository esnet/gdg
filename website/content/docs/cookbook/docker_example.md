You can configure gdg in a variety of different ways but if you want so use secret the is currently the simplest pattern:


```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/esnet/gdg:0.8.0
    volumes:
      - ./gdg.yml:/app/config/gdg.yml:ro
    secrets:
      - staging_auth.json
      - default.json

secrets:
  staging_auth.json:
    file: ./staging_auth.json
  default.json:
    file: ./default_connection_auth.json

```

Then update your config file with the following:

`secure_location: /run/secrets/`

For any connection settings, you will have to additionally define all the connection settings accordingly.

### Prior to 0.8

You can create a bash script that replaces the entrypoint as can be seen below:

```
#!/bin/sh
GDG_CONTEXTS__DEV__PASSWORD=`cat "$GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD__FILE"` exec /app/gdg "$@"
```

Note, bash is not in previous containers, it will be added to later versions so you'll have to use sh instead of bash.

This assumes that your grafana password is in a file called `gf_passwd`

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/esnet/gdg:0.7.2
    entrypoint: ["/bin/sh", "/app/wrapper.sh"]
    command: ["tools", "contexts", "show"]
    volumes:
      - ./importer.yml:/app/config/importer.yml:ro
      - ./wrapper.sh:/app/wrapper.sh
    environment:
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD__FILE=/run/secrets/gf_passwd
    secrets:
      - gf_passwd

secrets:
  gf_passwd:
    file: ./gf_passwd
```
