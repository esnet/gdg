On OS X with Homebrew you can just run brew install go.\nmake a copy of conf/importer-example.yml and name it conf/importer.yml You'll need GRAFANA ADMINISTRATIVE privileges to proceed.\nAuthentication Authentication Token You can use an Authentication Token / API Key to authenticate with the Grafana API, which can be generated in your Grafana Web UI =\u0026gt; Configuration =\u0026gt; API Keys. You can then use it in your configuration file (eg. importer.yml).\ncontext_name: main contexts: main: url: https://grafana.example.org token: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;Grafana API Token\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026quot; output_path: \u0026quot;myFolder\u0026quot; ignore_filters: False # When set to true all Watched filtered folders will be ignored and ALL folders will be acted on watched: - Example datasources: default: user: admin password: secret url_regex: ## set to pattern to match as well as the name. misc: user: admin password: secret url_regex: .*esproxy2* global: debug: true ignore_ssl_errors: false Username / Password You can also use username/password credentials of an admin user to authenticate with the Grafana API.

If the datasource has BasicAuth enabled, then we'll attempt to set the auth with the following precedence on matches:\n Match of DS credentials based on DS name. Match URL regex for the DS if regex specified. Use Default Credentials if the above two both failed.  Notes If you configure both, Auth Token and Username/Password, then the Token is given priority.\nWatched folders under grafana is a white list of folders that are being managed by the tool.
