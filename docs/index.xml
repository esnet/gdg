Packages for a few distributions have been added. The release cycle relies on goreleaser so anything that is well supported can be added it at some point.

      <description>Cloud Support Support for using a few cloud providers as a storage engine is now supported. When enabled, the local file system is only used for reading configuration files. Everything else relies on the data from the cloud provider matching up to your configuration.
Currently the following providers are supported:
