The main push for this was to support organizations a bit better, and the only way to really do this correctly was to change the destination path of where the orgs are being saved. Every entity that supports organization will now be namespace by the org it belongs to.</description></item><item><title>version v0.4</title><link>https://software.es.net/gdg/docs/releases/gdg_0.4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 15:21:01 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://software.es.net/gdg/docs/releases/gdg_0.4/</guid><description>Release Notes for v0.4.5 # Release Date: 07/13/2023
