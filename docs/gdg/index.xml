Packages for a few distributions have been added. The release cycle relies on goreleaser so anything that is well supported can be added it at some point. There is no APT or such you can connect to but the packages are available for download.
The following packages are currently supported:</description></item><item><title>Configuration</title><link>https://software.es.net/gdg/docs/gdg/configuration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://software.es.net/gdg/docs/gdg/configuration/</guid><description>Getting started # This project requires Go to be installed.

When enabled, the local file system is only used for reading configuration files. Everything else relies on the data from the cloud provider matching up to your configuration.
Currently the following providers are supported:

They should all work, but only S3 and Google have been properly tested.</description></item><item><title>Developer Guide</title><link>https://software.es.net/gdg/docs/gdg/developer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://software.es.net/gdg/docs/gdg/developer/</guid><description>Running Tests # Bring up a grafana instance locally with default credentials of admin/admin. docker-compose up -d grafana Once the instance is up simply run go test ./... or make test Making a release # Install goreleaser.
