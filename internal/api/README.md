Everything in here is intended implemented due to limitations or bugs found.

Currently, the /api/health is not documented via swagger therefore the extended API provides that functionality.

The /api/users is documented incorrectly and mapped to the wrong response type, so for the time being relying on a 
custom implementation to derive the same functionality.
